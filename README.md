Intermediate Programming

Section 2

Joanne Selinski 

This program runs the Skip-Bo game by Mattel. It uses a text based interface with menu optioning. 

To execute this program, type make in the command line.

When selecting a Skip-Bo card, enter 0 in the input (We felt this was easier than typing out Skip-Bo every time).

Core testing was also done.
Type make test in the command line to run the tests over the Board, Player, Computer, and Human Classes.

Please see: http://service.mattel.com/instruction_sheets/42050.pdf for a detailed description of the rules of Skip-Bo.
